This post is a bit of a rant and experience sharing, so bear with me please.

I like to understand the tools I use, at least for the most part. I use Windows,
and I know a thing or two about it, and I use Linux too, and at least I can say I
have installed arch (with the install script, of course, duh!) and that I can configure
a window manager to my likings and make custom bash scripts to do the things I need to do.
I'm no expert, but I like to tweak things around try to understand the tools that I use.
VSCode was not the differnce, I learnt how to be efficient in my own way and tried to squeeze
most of its value for my workflow, which was not complicated and most of the time I just needed
a fast git integration, a file picker and a good search and replace, which vscode had it all
and it's fair to say that they're all very easy to use. I stoppet using vscode because it's just
too bloated and started using neovim (hi prime, hi teej), and I'm no Neovim expert, but
I learned the shortcuts I needed and configured the plugins I wanted. Again, I want to stress
out the fact that I took time to learn the tool that I wanted to use and be efficient on it as far
as I needed to (and even today I keep learning stuff about it). But I think we all agree that there
are basic tasks that you need to learn when using a code editor, like finding files, finding text,
git integration if it's available, and such.

Now, here's where my rant really begins. I don't consider myself a very good senior dev,
but I've had to mentor others in the past and present day, and I have to say,
despite vscode being so popular, and despite developers using it from the start of their journey, I cannot stress enough
how anoying and tedious it's been telling someone over a call to search for 'filename.ext' and watch
them open their filetree scrolling up and down and opening and closing subfolders instead of just hitting
that sweet 'control-p' and type the filename and be done with it, or (and I'm not lying) tell them to search
for that weird 'console.log' in a big file and watch how they start scrolling up and down instead of hitting
'control-f'. And, don't get me wrong, these things don't happen to jr devs only, but with some considered senior
developers in mine and other teams as well. Now, some of these theme members are
the same that have told me in the past that not using AI while coding makes developer
look like 'cavemen', and more than baffled, this makes me feel worried about the kind
of developers that go out in the wild and tell people to use copilot but then proceed
to look for a file in their filetree of a project with 100 files and get scared when
a merge conflict pops up in their vscode because they don't know how to use the difftool
(let's all agree that vscode's difftool is the easiest to use) and don't even let me get
started on the ones that 'know' javascript (I mean, I don't consider myself an expert but
I sure don't get confused when I need to use object destructuring).

The use of the terminal is on another level. I do get not every job or programming
role requires to be an expert, but most tools require the use of the terminal
(like npm (don't use npm, use pnpm), nodejs, git, etc), but I cannot tell you how
many times I've told someone to cd into home to configurea x thing and they're like
'what's home', or please list the files in the directory and then it's just a cursor
blinking waiting for me to tell them to just type ls and enter. Again, I'm not an expert
at everything I do, but I'm sure watching a video in 'terminal basics' and 'how to use vscode'
won't hurt your productivity.

At the end of the day, I do get that not everyone learns at the same phase, and I try
to teach as much as I can on those little calls with my team members and be
comprehensive, but I cannot stop worrying about the fact that most developers
are not interested (or so it seems) in learning at least the basics about the
tools they use, but they are heavily invested in getting tools that do as much
as possible for them.

Anyway, that was my rant, my frustration let out. Thanks for comming to my non-ted talk.
